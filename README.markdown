##### This module forked and modified from stevenmerrill/graphiteapi

#### puppet-graphiteapi

_(Also includes carbon.)_

## Starting with graphiteapi

Install the other modules that are needed.

```
include graphiteapi
```

This will set up:

- Carbon using the packages
- graphite-api running on localhost:8080.

## Limitations

This module only runs on RHEL 6 to my knowledge.

This module does not provide for any configuration of Carbon yet.

## Testing

There are no actual tests to speak of at this time.

I have personally tested this and gotten it to work with Grafana without issue.
